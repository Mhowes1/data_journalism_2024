This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Task 1: Load libraries and establish settings:

`{r} setup, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
```

Task 2: load data

```{r}
quarter_one <- read_csv("data/JAN-MAR-2023-SOD.csv")
quarter_two <- read_csv("data/APRIL-JUNE 2023 SOD.csv")
quarter_three <- read_csv("data/JULY-SEPTEMBER-2023SOD.csv")
quarter_four <- read_csv("data/OCT-DEC-2023-SOD.csv")
quarter_five <- read_csv("data/JAN-MAR-2024-SOD-DETAIL-GRID-FINAL.csv")
```

Task 3: Fix the parsing error with quarter_three csv by deleting the extra column.

```{r}
quarter_three <- read_csv("data/JULY-SEPTEMBER-2023SOD.csv")

```

```{r}
problems(quarter_three)
```

```{r}
head(quarter_three)
```

```{r}
quarter_three_fixed <- quarter_three |>
  select(-...19)
```

Task 4: bind the dataframes so we have one year's worth of data

```{r}
full_year_2023 <- bind_rows(list(quarter_one, quarter_two, quarter_three_fixed, quarter_four, quarter_five))
view(full_year_2023)
```

Task 5: clean up data. Fix headers using janitor, fix datatype for dates and budget object codes.

```{r}
head(full_year_2023) 
```

```{r}
clean_full_year_2023 <- full_year_2023 |> 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
clean_full_year_2023 <- clean_full_year_2023 |> 
  mutate(
    start_date = dmy(perform_start_dt, quiet = TRUE), 
    end_date = dmy(perform_end_dt, quiet = TRUE)
  )
```


```{r}
  clean_full_year_2023$budget_object_code <- as.character(clean_full_year_2023$budget_object_code)
```

Finding 1: Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.) was the program’s top spender last year. He was reimbursed more than \$32,000 for lodging and nearly \$12,000 for meals in 2023, according to data released by the House as of Tuesday.

Step 1: Filter for Bergman's expenses. His organization name (2023 HON. JACK BERGMAN) isn't great for r because of the spacing and punctuation, so let's use his organzation code: MI01BEJ. 


```{r}
bergman_expenses <- clean_full_year_2023 |>
  filter(organization_code == "MI01BEJ") 

```

Step 2: Make a new datagram filtering for Bergman's personal travel and lodging expenses that he sought reimbursement for using budget codes 2107 and 2109, which we identified as the relevant codes using this article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/13/house-expenses-receipts-database-list/. Make the result a little easier to read using select. (first dataframe probably not necessary, but helped us to think through the problem)


```{r}
bergman_program_expenses <- bergman_expenses |>
  select(description, budget_object_code, amount, start_date, end_date)  |>
  filter(budget_object_code == "2107" | budget_object_code == "2109") 
```

```{r}
total_bergman_program_expenses <- bergman_program_expenses |>
    group_by(budget_object_code) |>
    summarize(
        total_amount = sum(amount)
    )
```



NOTE: At this point we found that Bergman does not have any budget expenses recorded with these codes. We are not sure why. One possible explanation is that there are other codes besides the two shown in the article linked above. We contacted the author of the article (Clara Ence Morse) to ask if there are other codes we should look for. In the meantime, we moved on to finding #2. 


Finding #2: Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was the program’s second-highest overall spender, according to filings released as of Tuesday, with over $30,000 in lodging expenses and more than $11,000 for meals in 2023.

Task 1: Create dataframe of just Gaetz's expenses using filter. let's use his organzation code: FL01GAM.

```{r}
gaetz_expenses <- clean_full_year_2023 |>
  filter(organization_code == "FL01GAM")
```

Task 2:Make a new datagram filtering for Gaetz's personal travel and lodging expenses that he sought reimbursement for using budget codes 2107 and 2109, which we identified as the relevant codes using this article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/13/house-expenses-receipts-database-list/. Make the result a little easier to read using select. (first dataframe probably not necessary, but helped us to think through the problem)

```{r}
gaetz_program_expenses <- gaetz_expenses|>
  select(description, budget_object_code, amount, start_date, end_date)  |>
  filter(budget_object_code == "2107" | budget_object_code == "2109")

```

Task 3: add up the total spending on meals and lodging.

```{r}
gaetz_program_expenses |>
  group_by(budget_object_code) |>
  summarize(
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  )
  
```
NOTE: these results are close to the numbers from the article ("over $30,000 in lodging expenses and more than $11,000 for meals in 2023"), but not quite the same. This could be because we need to include other budget object codes (BOC), or because there is some error in the data that we downloaded or that we created while cleaning the data. We hope that when we resolve the BOC question we will be closer to an answer.

Finding 3: Swalwell, who purchased a $1,215,000 home in the Eckington neighborhood of Washington, was reimbursed more than $20,000 for lodging expenses in 2023, according to the data released as of Tuesday. In May 2023, he received $2,838 in lodging reimbursement. 

Step 1: Find the total lodging number

```{r}
Swalwell_expenses <- clean_full_year_2023 |>
  filter(organization_code == "CA15SWE")
```

```{r}
Swalwell_program_expenses <- Swalwell_expenses|>
  select(description, budget_object_code, amount, start_date, end_date)  |>
  filter(budget_object_code == "2107")
```

```{r}
Swalwell_program_expenses |>
  group_by(budget_object_code) |>
  summarize(
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  )
```
Step 2: Narrow down the data to May 2023. 

```{r}
Swalwell_program_expenses |>
  group_by(start_date, end_date) |>
  summarize(
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  )
```
No. 4: Mace, who co-owns a $1,649,000 Capitol Hill townhouse she purchased in 2021 with her then-fiancé, Patrick Bryant, expensed a total of $27,817 in 2023, an average of more than $2,300 a month, according to the data released as of Tuesday. She expensed over $3,000 for lodging in January, March and May, and over $4,000 for lodging in October.

Step 1: Consolidate the data to just be Mace's data. Code: SC01MAN 

```{r}
mace_expenses <- clean_full_year_2023 |>
  filter(organization_code == "SC01MAN")
```

```{r}
mace_program_expenses <- mace_expenses |>
  select(description, budget_object_code, amount, start_date, end_date) |>
  filter(budget_object_code == "2107" | budget_object_code == "2109") |>
  filter(lubridate::year(start_date) == 2023) |>
  group_by(budget_object_code) |>
  summarize(
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  ) 
```

```{r}
mace_program_expenses
```




This shows that Mace expensed $27,817.00 on lodging in 2023, aligning with the Washington Post story. By dividing the figure by 12 (months in the year), you receive an average of $2,318, matching the Washington Post story.

Step 2: Next, we want to see the monthly totals for January, March, May and October. 

```{r}
mace_expenses |>
  group_by(start_date, end_date) |>
  filter(budget_object_code == "2107") |>
  summarize(
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  )
```




The table shows that Mace expensed $3,196 in January 2023, $3,354 in March 2023, $3,612 in May 2023 and $4,176 in October. All these figures match the Washington Post story.


No. 5: Some members of Congress who own homes in the Washington area, including Reps. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), have chosen not to participate in the program at all. Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who owns a $1 million home in Virginia, was reimbursed less than $1,500 each month.


Step 1: I want to make it just Rep. Banks' data, so I will isolate his from the other congresspeople. Code: IN03BAJ


```{r}
banks_expenses <- clean_full_year_2023 |>
  filter(organization_code == "IN03BAJ")
```

Step 2: Next I want to make sure that the budget object codes are just for the lodging and meals. I also will group it by the start_date and end_date to see the monthly totals and determine if it matches the Washington Post story. 

```{r}
banks_expenses |>
  group_by(start_date, end_date) |>
  filter(budget_object_code == "2107" | budget_object_code == "2109") |>
  summarize(
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  )
```

The table confirms that Banks did not recieve more than $1,500 a month in 2023, with his highest total being $1,463.02 in June.
